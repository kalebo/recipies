Sous vide fried chicken 
=======
rev. 1

Here follows a record of my endevors of mastering the art of frying chicken.

---

#### Common 
* Chicken (obviously)
* Panko
* Flour 
* Buttermilk
* Olive oil

#### Dredging mix (optional) 
* baking powder
* Tabasco
* Salt and pepper
* Paprika
* Cayenne pepper
* Garlic powder
* Thyme


1. Cook chicken in water bath at 65°C for 2.5+ hrs. Include water olive oil in bags.
  * @2.5 chicken had good taste and texture, but some gristle was still present.
  * Next time try putting a little butter milk
  * maybe soak with a little Tabasco sauce

2. Dredge chicken in buttermilk and then in a mixture of flour and panko bread crumbs and salt, pepper, paprika, cayenne pepper, thyme and garlic powder to taste.
  * I wasn't thinking and  mixed the wet with the dry. Although that piece spit a lot it did get one of the best coatings.
  * Try using self rising flour or adding 1 tsp of baking powder for every cup of flour.

3. Fill the cast iron pan up to 1/3 with oil and heat it up. Try to aim at 350°F before lowering the chicken in. Try for 5 minutes on each side or until they are nicely browned.
  * it splashed alot last time. I need get a splash screen next time.
