Sous vide fried chicken 
=======
rev. 1

Here follows a record of my endevors of mastering the art of frying chicken.

---

#### Common 
* Chicken (obviously)
* Panko
* Flour 
* Buttermilk
* Olive oil

#### Dredging mix (optional) 
* baking powder
* Tabasco
* Salt and pepper
* Paprika
* Cayenne pepper
* Garlic powder
* Thyme

#### Notes

1. Cook chicken in water bath at 65°C for 2.5+ hrs. Include olive oil in bags.
  * @2.5 chicken had good taste and texture, but some gristle was still present.
  * I put a 1/2 pint (the short cartons) of buttermilk at the begining of cooking process; it would be good to include some other marinade and/or spice (maybe tabasco).
  * I put 6 drumsticks that were still a little frozen and let them cook for about 5 hours and they turned out great. I could probably put them in frozen in the morning and take them out when I get back in the evening.

2. Dredge chicken in buttermilk and then in a mixture of flour and panko bread crumbs and salt, pepper, paprika, cayenne pepper, thyme and garlic powder to taste.
  * In one of my first tests I mixed wet and dry and that piece spit a lot it did get one of the best coatings.
  * I tried adding 1 tsp of baking powder for every cup of flour. I'm not sure how much of a difference made, but I'll probably keep doing it.
  * I might try to do double breading. 
  * Use more salt next time.

3. Fill the cast iron pan up to 1/3 with oil and heat it up. Try to aim at 350°F before lowering the chicken in. cook  until they are nicely browned on each side.
  * Make sure to use a lid and a old long sleeve shirt.
